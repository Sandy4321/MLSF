# MLSF
Multi-Label Classification by Mining Meta-Label Specific Features.

This is a example MATLAB program for conducting experiments in [1].

The program includes five multi-label classification methods:

[5] LLSF: J. Huang et al, Learning label specific features for multi-label classifcation, ICDM, 2015.

The following package is necessary for executing the program:

LIBSVM -- A Library for Support Vector Machines;
